### Community Luncheon

Replacing our traditional Town Hall session, the **Community Luncheon** offers a more relaxed and engaging forum for community interaction. This 90-minute session, held during the lunch break, invites participants to ask questions, propose ideas, and discuss any gem5-related topic—whether professionally or casually.

Boxed lunches will be provided, and attendees are encouraged to remain in the room to eat and connect. This informal environment is designed to strengthen ties between users and developers and to foster transparent and collaborative conversations within the gem5 ecosystem.
